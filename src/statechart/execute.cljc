(ns statechart.execute
  "Pure interpreter for Harel statecharts. State is plain data — inspectable,
  replayable, testable offline with fixture ports.

  Configuration: a set of currently-active state ids (atomic states + their
  compound/parallel ancestors, mirroring SCXML semantics).

  Entry actions run parent-first (shallow to deep); exit actions run child-first
  (deep to shallow). Parallel states activate all orthogonal regions; compound
  states recurse into their :sc/initial child.

  A machine state is: {:sc/config #{...} :sc/ctx ctx :sc/done? bool}.
  Ports map: {:action IAction :guard IGuard}."
